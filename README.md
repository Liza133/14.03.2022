 ** 1.**
Write a function that receives two strings and returns n, where n is equal to the number of characters we should shift the first string forward to match the second. The check should be case sensitive.

For instance, take the strings "fatigue" and "tiguefa". In this case, the first string has been rotated 5 characters forward to produce the second string, so 5 would be returned.

If the second string isn't a valid rotation of the first string, the method returns -1.

** 2.**
Did you ever want to know how many days old are you? Complete the function which returns your age in days. The birthday is given in the following order: year, month, day.

For example if today is 30 November 2015 then

ageInDays(2015, 11, 1) returns "You are 29 days old"
The birthday is expected to be in the past.

Suggestions on how to improve the kata are welcome!

** 3.**
Write a program that will calculate the number of trailing zeros in a factorial of a given number.

N! = 1 * 2 * 3 * ... * N

Be careful 1000! has 2568 digits...
